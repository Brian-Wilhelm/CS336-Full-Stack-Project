# CS336-Full-Stack-Project
A full stack web application for the purposes of displaying information on restaurants, customers, and transactions.

This project makes use of JSP webpages to query information from a MySQL database.

The project allows for the retrieval and display of information on specfic customers at bars and the beers those bars sell.
Information on the input customer, bar, or beer is displayed in the form of tables and graphs making use of Highcharts.

Notable features:
  Routing between webpages
  Use of post and get requests to handle user input and trasnfer data between webpages
  Organized display of information
  Database design and implementation
  
Areas of improvement:
  Add styling to webpages to make it look better
